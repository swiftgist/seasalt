Set up Chrony or ntp to manage system time.  Chrony is preferred.

Ceph relies on synchronized clocks. DeepSea will by default start a chrony 
client on each minion.  If chrony is not available, then ntp must be selected
in the pillar.  In either case, the default time server is the Salt master 
unless overridden.  The Salt master must be configured manually.  (Salt can be
used for setting up a time server, but admins have strong opinions about the
correct configuration for time.  The Salt master is suitable for virtual
environments.)

To force the time server to use chrony, ntp or be disabled, add one of the 
following to /srv/pillar/ceph/stack/global.yml:

time_init: chrony
time_init: ntp
time_init: disabled

Run Stage 2 or `salt '*' saltutil.refresh_pillar` to update the pillar.

** Developer note
Each state file removes the other configuration.  Chrony will remove ntp and
ntp will remove chrony.  If a third system is ever supported, the removal of
the configuration could be separated.  Although rescind seems like an
appropriate place, rescind is based on role assignments.
