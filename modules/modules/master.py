"""
Several orchestrations must target the minion running on the Salt master.
Currently, the Salt master and admin node are one in the same.  Originally, the
installation process would populate /srv/pillar/ceph/master_minion.sls.  This
fails in environments where an entire server is built prior to assigning a
 hostname or configuring Salt.

On the off chance that we may have multiple Salt masters or separate the admin
node from the Salt master, keep /srv/pillar/ceph/master_minion.sls to allow the
administrator to override the setting in /etc/salt/minion_id.

Note that this is a module that only runs on the master.
